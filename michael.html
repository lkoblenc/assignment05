	<h2>Academics</h2>

	<p>Freshman year I wasn’t sure what I wanted to major in so I chose a bunch of prerequisites and eventually ended up going towards geomechanics, which I eventually swapped out for environmental science sophomore spring. I didn’t enjoy many classes as an undergrad but eventually took the intro to Python course, CSC 161, which I liked enough to cram a CS minor into my degree. I’ve also completed clusters in European History and Russian Studies. My favorite class so far has been Hitler’s Germany (HIS 126) followed by Intro to Java (CSC 171), Vikings (HIS 125), and Engineering Statics (ME 120).</p>

	<h2>Jobs</h2>

	<p>I’ve had two internships while at U of R, both in 2018. Over Spring break last year I worked at Chobani, a Greek yogurt company that has offices about 30 mins from Greene in Norwich, NY. I didn’t do anything related to yogurt, instead I copied and filed/digitized physical invoices for an upcoming audit. My other internship was during summer break, where I worked for a marketing company in Binghamton as an “inside sales representative.” Pickings are slim in Binghamton for student internships/coops unless you are in mechanical engineering (Lockheed Martin is nearby), so I went on Indeed and applied for a bunch of things until I got a response. At the company I talked to contractors/painters/landscapers/etc. over the phone on behalf of Lowe’s - direct business to business marketing where I would either update their contact info (so that we could send them stuff) or try to sell them a product. Telemarketing isn’t a very fun job since you either get a lot of voicemails or have the same conversation hundreds of times per day. I was surprised that I didn’t hate it but I probably wouldn’t want to do it as my career.</p>

	<h2>Hobbies</h2>

	<p>For hobbies I like casual cycling and kayaking, and sometimes I commit to jogging a couple times a week if it’s warm out. I used to play soccer and tennis in high school but I’ve only been playing intramural squash while at U of R. I follow the NBA most closely out of all the professional sports, but don’t have a favorite team – I usually bandwagon a team that isn’t Golden State. If I had to pick a favorite this year it’d be the Denver Nuggets.</p>
