	<h2>Academics</h2>

	<p>I am currently taking a class on Financial Statement Analysis that covers the applied financial analysis and valuation skills that are required to work on Wall Street in, for example, investment banking and equity research firms. The objective of this class is to develop and sharpen one’s analytical ability to use financial information to perform a wide variety of applied economic and financial analysis. Last semester, I took Corporate Finance that I found very interesting. The course examined corporate financing policy – thus our primary focus was on the liability side of the firm’s balance sheet. We examined the valuation of debt and equity claims under the simplifying assumptions made by Modigliani and Miller. We also examined how relaxing those assumptions provides a basis for understanding financing policy choices. We looked at leverage, the use of public vs. private debts, maturity, priority, leasing, and hedging policies. Finally, we also discussed competition and dividend policies.</p>

	<h2>Jobs</h2>

	<p>I have not done an actual internship but ultimately, I would like to start my own non-profit in Burundi (my hometown), one that is focused on helping women and children pull themselves out of poverty. However, building a non-profit that is self-sustainable and that lasts turned out to be harder than it looked but I am not giving up.</p>

	<h2>Hobbies</h2>

	<p>This past year, I started rethinking my entire major when I fell in love with programming. As a senior, all I can do now is take any class I can fit in my schedule. Now, my greatest passion is to code during spare time and to improve my programming skills.</p>
