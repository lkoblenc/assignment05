	<h2>Tom</h2>

	<p>Hi, my name is Thomas Hogrefe. I’m a senior at the University of Rochester studying Political Science with a minor in Computer Science. Outside of class, I’m a member of Sigma Phi Epsilon and a Speaking Fellow. I enjoy aviation and programming in my spare time.</p>

	<h2>Michael</h2>

	<p>I’m a senior full time student from a small town called Greene, NY, about 3 hours south from here (near Binghamton). Binghamton is a rust-belt relic that has suffered from declining population and a poor economy over the past few decades, but recently has seen a revival thanks to business incentive programs and the growth of Binghamton University. Greene is about 20 miles north of Binghamton and has a population of ~5,000. Greene is nicer than many similar rural villages located nearby thanks to the presence of the Raymond Corporation, which employs more than ~1,000 people. Raymond, a subsidiary of Toyota that leads the forklift industry, has been headquartered in Greene since its formation in 1840. Greene’s school system usually yields 70-90 students per grade (my class had 76), has pretty decent average test scores for a small school but doesn’t offer AP courses – which can make applying for colleges difficult. Luckily, I ended up getting into U of R and will be graduating in May.</p>

	<h2>Chadia</h2>

	<p>I am a senior at the University of Rochester majoring in Financial Economics with a minor in Business. Before transferring to the U of R a couple years ago, I was living in Austin, Texas. Most recently, I was working as a Fundraising coordinator for a local non-profit called Humans for Education that helps schools in Kenya become financially independent and in turn make sure every child has access to quality education. Now, I have been working as a Workshop Leader for Calculus III and Python. It has been a very rewarding experience because I realized that no matter how much you know about a subject, there is always room to learn more.</p>
